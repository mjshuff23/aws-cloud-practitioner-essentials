## Networking

- We need to understand the basic concepts of networking and the difference between public and private networking resources to keep our data and our client's data safe and secure.
- An **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** lets you provision a logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.  These resources can be public or private facing. 
- Usually for backend services like databases or application servers, the public and private grouping of resources are known as **Subnets**, which are ranged of IP addresses in your VPC
- If we had a coffee shop with a cashier and a barista, the cashier would be in the public subnet because we want them to interact with the customers and the barista would be in the private subnet to keep them away from the customers
