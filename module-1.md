### Cloud Compute Model

Almost all modern computing centers around a basic client/server model.  Basically a customer makes a request, and the server will serve that request. In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

### Server Instances

- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computer).  A virtual machine/server

## Cloud Computing

- Cloud computer is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing that are ready to use when you need them
- The goal of AWS is to create services to automate repetitive, monotonous tasks so that you can focus more on what you want to offer your clients

### Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

- When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.
- The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid
  - **Cloud-Based Development**
    - Runs all parts of the application from the cloud
    - Migrate existing applications to the cloud
    - Design and build new applications in the cloud
    - In a **cloud-based deployment** model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications to the cloud.  You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them.  Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure
    - For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking component that are fully based in the cloud
  - **On-Premises Deployment**
    - Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
    - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
    - **On-premises deployment** is also known as a *private cloud* deployment.  In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
    - For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center.  Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, it's incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization
  - **Hybrid Deployment**
    - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
    - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
    - In a **hybrid development**, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.  You might want to use this approach in a number of situations.  For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises
    - For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics.  However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud.  With a hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud
